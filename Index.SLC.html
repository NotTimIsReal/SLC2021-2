<h3>-Science</h3>
<p>For Science we use the manage pillar, that pillar is to make sure that we manage our time. </p>

<h2>Relate</h2>
<h3>LOTE(French)</h3>
<p>I have chosen language for the relate pillar as we use the pillar R4- Communicate effectively.<br> We would obviously use this pillar as we need to talk to learn our language</p>
<h2>Inquire</h2>
<h3>-PDHPE</h3>
<p>For the Inquire pillar I chose the I2 sub pillar, the subject that is associated with this is PDHPE.<br>Research, organise and process information, is what I2 is and we did in-fact do research for<br> PDHPE in the first term.</p>
<h2>Witness</h2>
<h3>-Religion</h3>
<p>Religion is the only subject that is in the witness pillar- the sub pillar is W2 which is,W2 -<br> Display Hope for the future. I can see why religion is in this as we should always have the<br> best hopes in the future hello! lol </p>
